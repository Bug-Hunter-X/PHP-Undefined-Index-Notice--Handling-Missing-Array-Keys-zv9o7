In PHP, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this code:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

//Attempting to access via a non-existent key
echo $myArray["key2"]; //Notice: Undefined index: key2 in ...

//This works, but only if the key exists
if (isset($myArray["key2"])) {
  echo $myArray["key2"];
}

//Best Practice
echo $myArray["key1"] ?? 'default value'; // Using null coalescing operator
?>
```

This code will issue a warning.  While `isset()` checks for existence, it's often verbose.  Using the null coalescing operator (`??`) provides a cleaner way to handle potentially missing keys without warnings.
